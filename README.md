# 📊 BCG Data Science Virtual Experience (Forage)

This repository showcases my completed work for the **Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Data Science Job Simulation** hosted on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-experience/Tcz8gTtprzAS4xSoK/bcg/data-science-ccdz).  
It simulates a real-world data science consulting case — from understanding the business context to generating actionable insights.
